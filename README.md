    How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
    
 It is best to create code that is modular and can be easily transfered, as well as keeping it clean and dorganized. It is also good practicew to refactor code frequently to make sure to keep it simplified.
    
    How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
    
 I think the apporaching the reuirements as a computer scientist means that you look at it requirements and start thinking about what the aspects you are creating are and how to go about them in an modular pieces. 
    
    What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientist are their to help test and implement a solution to ideas and problems the the company has and help them become more profitable
